        <p class="article">Over the last three to four weeks, Honourable PM Shri Narendra Modiji has been launching, inaugurating various infrastructural projects and educational institutions in poll-bound states. Infra drive by governments seems quite successful. However, his open unhesitant insistence on double engine government raised some questions. Are states with non-BJP governments treated step-mannerly? Recent comments by Satyapal Malik intrigued an argument: Central and state leaders are becoming more self-centric than ever before. When we got independence, provided with a constitution, we got arguably the best form of democracy built over three pillars: parliament, an independent judicial system, and allegedly independent executives. One must have expected that our political democracy has matured enough as of now, but we might say that it did reach its peak and constantly deteriorating over time.<br>
        We can observe bitterness at its peak, extreme polarisation of society for momentary political gain, alleged purchasing of MLA's by many political parties, no-ideology alliances, contraction of democratic space to just elections. We at least expect executives to be independent, but it does not seem so. Acts of governors like blocking files, proposals from some state governments and on the opposite, allowing others to act outside their constitutional sphere is quite a lousy picture. The devotion of top bureaucracy to the ruling party over self-wisdom both at the state and central level for alleged future-proofing is a severe concern. At this stage, we cannot even think of independent thought driven MP's who, at some point in time, will oppose the position of their party based on solid personal beliefs. Authentic parliamentary practices are bypassed in this high command and whip culture. The introduction of a bill after an ordinance, without good internal discussion within neither ruling formation nor cabinet, is covered up by arguing its immediate requirement indicates disbelief in parliamentary processes. We all have seen the way bills are being passed in parliament, loosely drafted, and even a single amendment by opposition MP's is not inculcated. As per our understanding of emergency, it might not be an exaggeration that this is the second time we have seen this kind of targeted use of government agencies. We should not blame just the current government because it is in accordance with previous governments but at a higher level. <br>
        Overall federal structure seems to be damaged as the federal government is trying to bring uniformity to the entire country. Uniformity is not bad as long as we allow the celebration of differences. They may be in languages, religions, festivals, history, geography, food and beliefs. It is correct and high time for the federal government to give up upon centralising powers and decision-making. If they do not, this centralisation will probably increase in future governments as we usually tend to quickly imitate and worsen bad practices. Intra-party democracy should not be just mouth service. A genuinely independent election commission should monitor it to prevent parties from becoming a family-run and single-person lead. <br>
        How lucrative a single leader or family-run party may sound to many of us, it does not matter in the end, leading to an autocratic system. This type of arrangement does not justify regional sentiments, ultimately not good for the entire nation. Rethinking about 'whip' is required for true democracy, as we cannot or better should not hide behind walls like democracy with 'Indian Characteristics'.<br>
        Finance of political parties requires strict watch of some independent institutions. Local bodies need to be empowered, monetarily, and more autonomy should be given as they are the nearest access points for any citizen. It will further diversify power distribution. States should get a higher cut of taxes provided that corruption is strictly at a negligible level. In today's world, data is called new oil. That's why it is the duty of government to protect the privacy of its citizens. Celebrities of all fields in any society play an important role in driving people's opinions. They should speak their heart and not the pocket. After all, democracy is a system of people, chosen and run by people, for the prosperity of people and nation. So, we, people, are at the heart of democracy. We should keep well into our mind that 'we buy a product and not the company'. Thus, we should not commit our vote to a political party on bases like caste, religion. People need not confine themselves to any party. If we choose the best representatives, the best governments are bound to form.<br>
        All of this might sound idealistic. However, that is what our ultimate goal should be because our freedom fighters and forefathers or foremothers did not certainly spend their lives for this form of democracy/swaraj. They did expect ideal or better than our all time best. (in my opinion, around 1997 to 2008, which is relatively average in itself.)<br>
